          distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
          or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

          the cloud:precise-folsom/updates repository instead, since Cinder
          was not available in the Ubuntu archive for Precise and is only
          available via the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.
